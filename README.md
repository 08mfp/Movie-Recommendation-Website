# Movie-Recommendation-Website

As part of a group in out First Year Team Project (For University), we developed this movie recommendation where you(the user) is able to answer 5 questions to recieve a personalized recommendation of 5 movies based on what we think will be perfect for you to watch.

The website has been built using React.js, HTML, CSS and an API that allowed us to access an extensive movie catalogue.
